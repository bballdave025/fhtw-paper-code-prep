Stuff to clone onto Amazon AWS SageMaker instances for different models. Different notebooks with different models and different platforms (TF, Torch).

<br/>

You might want to go down to the discussion of models, Jupyter Notebooks, drafts of papers to publish, etc. For now, though, you'd need to wait for me to write that part. A Good place to look until I get that done is my repo for [rib-wrist-in-bin-din](https://github.com/bballdave025/rib-wrist-in-bin-din/tree/main), one of the funding-attracting type names I've come up with, standing for <strong>R</strong>eused <strong>I</strong>nformation <strong>B</strong>earing <strong>Wri</strong>ting <strong>S</strong>urface <strong>T</strong>races <strong>in</strong> <strong>Bin</strong>-<strong>Din</strong>-gs. Especially interesting (though <em>very</em> drafty) are a Google Drive hosted [draft of the more-technical paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JAIL4PFmIm3_gScfscTj88yXKjorG7NIcXnTlT2IcSI/edit?usp=sharing)&emdash;for now a chain-of-consciousness discussion that incorporates my literature search, the types of models I plan to use or have already scaffolded, and some goals on classification metrics. Something that goes even more into the "why" of the project, discussing how many documents I want to search through to find these <strong>R</strong>Reused <strong>M</strong>Manuscript <strong>F</strong>ragments in <strong>B</strong>indings (RMFBs) and giving visualizations and references for some of the Deep Learning architectures I want to use, is a [Jupyter notebook with some of my vision and the plans for my baseline](https://github.com/bballdave025/rib-wrist-in-bin-din/blob/main/Paper_Code_Prep_01.ipynb) (a Vanilla CNN for identification on the CIFAR-10 dataset).

For now, I'm putting in `README`s for the models to be used, analyzed, and perhaps voted on by a much later ensemble model. They're somewhat in the order of complexity, but don't quote me on that.

## Useful Commands for Dave

### Convert Commands

#### 0

```bash
identify \
  -format "
      \n\n%f\n%[magick] %[colorspace] %[type] \
              %[extension] %[bit-depth] %[channels]\n
" \
  *.tiff | tr -s ' '  #  TIFF as example
```

often with the output redirected to a file, as shown below.

An example of my most-used `0` command, then (using aliases I detail, below), is

```bash
ttdate && \
  time \
    identify -format "
      \n\n%f\n%[magick] %[colorspace] %[type] \
              %[extension] %[bit-depth] %[channels]\n" \
          *.tiff | tr -s ' ' \
        > informative_filename_$(ttdate).out \
    && ttdatechk
```

where the following two aliases have been created: 

```
alias ttdate="date +'%s_%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%S%z'"

alias ttdatechk='  echo -e "$(ttdate)\nExitedNormally" '\
'               || echo -e "$(ttdate)\nExitedNonZero" '\
'; ttdate; echo "  (this may be a BONUS timestamp)";'
```

included in (something sourced by) my `$HOME/.bashrc`, though typing them at the
terminal prompt works, too.

<br/>

#### 1

```bash
mogrify -colorspace srgb -type truecolor *.jpg
```

<strong>IMPORTANT!!!</strong>
ALWAYS USE A COMMAND LIKE THIS, <strong>WITHOUT ANY `-quality PERCENT`
FLAG</strong>, WHEN DOING CONVERSIONS FROM JPEG TO (DIFFERENT-FORMAT)
JPEG.

An example of my most-used `1` command, then (using aliases I detailed in '0', above), is

```bash
ttdate && \
  time \
    mogrify -colorspace srgb -type truecolor *.jpg \
  && ttdatechk
```

<br/>

#### 2

```bash
mogrify -format jpg -quality 92 -colorspace srgb -type truecolor *.png
```

A `quality` of `92` is pretty standard<sup>1</sup>.

An example of my most-used `2` command, then (using aliases I detailed in '0', above), is

```bash
ttdate && \
  time \
    mogrify -colorspace srgb -type truecolor *.jpg \
  && ttdatechk
```

<br/>

#### 3

```bash
mogrify -format jpg -quality 92 *.tiff  # *.tiff for an example
```

An example of my most-used `3` command, then (using aliases I detailed in '0', above), is

```bash
ttdate && \
  time \
    mogrify -format jpg -quality 92 *.tiff \
  && ttdatechk
```

<br/>

#### 4

```bash

#  hopefully it's faster when not working on files on the external hard drive
#+ [ ... working with stuff ... ]
#+ yes, it goes much faster with the files on the local machine
```

<br/>

### Notes

1. I'm talking loose and fast by saying "pretty standard". I think the best way to
see why I call this standard is to look at the default settings for a few widely-
used programs.

I'll put in links to more formal research, later, though I'll note
that I like the analysis at
[Lenspiration](https://web.archive.org/web/20250619215342/https://www.lenspiration.com/2020/07/what-quality-setting-should-i-use-for-jpg-photos/)
(that's an archived version) about JPEG quality in (Adobe) [Lightroom](https://lightroom.adobe.com/)
(that's not an archived version).
From what I can gather, the actual pixel output (in Lightroom) is the same
(or more likely only trivially different)
anywhere in the 93-100 range, and similarly the same in the 85-92 range.
It keeps going like that for 11 more ranges or bands of quality value.
Though I didn't see the details of the experimental method used for the
"(Subjective) JPG quality at 100% zoom" for each quality setting, it seems 
very little different between 92 (or 93) and 100, while the file size grows
markedly (following a previously visible exponential trend) between
about 90 and 95.

<br/>

#### Default Settings

##### ImageMagick: 

92 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
[documentation (archived version)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250716224304/http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php)

used to be 85 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[source from 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20250719200242/https://imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?t=16751), 
which is after the change had been made

<br/>

##### GIMP:

90 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Found just now, after I downloaded the newest stable GIMP 3.0.4, by exporting an
image as with a `.jpg` extension and pressing the <kbd>Reset to FactoryDefaults</kbd> button. Right after I finished,
I got the UNIX Timestamp as `1752957414` which is the same as `Sat Jul 19 20:36:54 UTC 2025` (from `date -u`)
I found the same version when following similar steps in version 2.10.

<br/>

##### Irfanview:

80 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
[Irfanview Forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20250720161514/https://irfanview-forum.de/forum/program/support/98629-can-t-save-default-jpg-quality)

<br/>

##### Adobe Lightroom:

90 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
[Adobe Community post](https://web.archive.org/web/20250720154131/https://community.adobe.com/t5/lightroom-ecosystem-cloud-based-discussions/lightroom-cc-export-res-mobile-vs-desktop/m-p/10566888) 

<br/>

##### Picasa

85  [Google Sites](https://web.archive.org/web/20250720154425/https://sites.google.com/site/picasaresources/picasa/save-photos)

Note that the formatting/style went a little wacky for the archived version 
(at least in my view of it). Scroll past the big images of an X and a 
magnifying glass, some other stuff, and another magnifying glass, and then 
you should be able to see the content just fine.

<br/>

##### Canva

80 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This isn't a standard/default value (it
seems the user picks their default when installing), but the value I most often
saw in Google results was 80.

<br/>

##### Snapseed:

95 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
[GadgetHacks > Smartphones](https://web.archive.org/web/20250720160842/https://smartphones.gadgethacks.com/how-to/snapseed-101-save-photos-full-quality-0180555/)

<br/>

##### Photoprism:

92 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
[GitHub issue on the Photoprism repo](https://web.archive.org/web/20250722141918/https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/2215)

<br/>

##### Picsart:

No default.

<br/>

##### Affinity Photo:

100 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
[Affinity Forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20250720161928/https://forum.affinity.serif.com/index.php?/topic/41561-saving-jpg-ctrl-s-quality-is-100-how-to-setup/)

Someone should get fired. That's taking up a bunch of extra, unneeded storage (though I guess it's less than the RAW version).

<br/>

##### Firefox:

92 (sometimes stated as 0.92) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ???

##### Suggestions from a website

[Sirv](https://web.archive.org/web/20250722161503/https://sirv.com/help/articles/dynamic-imaging/format/)

> For best results, we recommend that you upload uncompressed JPEGs â€“ at least 92% quality or above.

a \[sic\] for the intimation that "uncompressed" is equivalent to "92% (\[sic\] on the '%', too) quality or above"

Maybe `<strong>@TODO</strong>` : Look for suggestions from other websites.

There's a good discussion in the comments:

>  But possibly it is the case that quality number 0-100 isn't actually part of the jpeg standard (i.e. there aren't quantization tables specified in the standard by a given quality number) and so there IS no direct translation between adobes and libjpegs quality numbers because they actually use different quantization tables altogether. If that is the case, then there really isn't a translation between them and the answer you pointed to is as good as it is going to get. â€“John Robertson | Dec 3, 2014 at 19:15

>  It actually _is_ defined in [the standard](https://web.archive.org/web/20250722164256/https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2435#section-4.2) but many encoders use a 0-100 scale which doesn't correspond to this. â€“mattdm | Dec 3, 2014 at 19:25

And let's finish with this comment from `libjpeg`'s README, quoted

It turns out that comes from the 
[`README` of v.8](https://web.archive.org/web/20250722144855/https://github.com/videoP/jaPRO/blob/master/lib/jpeg-8c/README), 
though the current version is v.9. An active fork called `libjpeg-turbo`, 
used by some programs, including ImageMagick, still uses v.8, though.
