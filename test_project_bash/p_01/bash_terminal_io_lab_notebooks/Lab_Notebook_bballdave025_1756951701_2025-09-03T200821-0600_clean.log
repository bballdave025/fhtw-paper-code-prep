  DO NOT MISS reading the pre-running instructions, in the p_01

  allow the files to run from your repo, whether on your local
  machine or on any online/VPN/other machine.
  THIS IS NECESSARY WHETHER ON WINDOWS OR *NIX!
  DO NOT PROCEED FURTHER WITHOUT FOLLOWING THOSE INSTRUCTIONS!

  From bash, usage should be
    $ python "$TAG_DIR/scripts/normalize_eol.py \"
         --root "$TAG_DIR" \"
         --map 'sh=lf,ps1=crlf,cmd=crlf,py=lf,ipynb=lf,md=lf'

  where <path-to-tagdir> is analogous to

  (Note that any files that should be excluded/ignored
   are covered in the Git repo's root .gitignore file.)
