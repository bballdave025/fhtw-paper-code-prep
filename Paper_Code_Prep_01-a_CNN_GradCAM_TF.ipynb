    "There are several reasons for writing these notebooks and doing these various visualizations. The most acceptable (I almost put that in quotation marks; I mean the most-what-employers-or-theoretical-AI/ML-people-would-like-to-hear) answers are: <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) I want to give <strong>greater explainability of the CV model  decisions</strong>,  especially as it relates to the audience of the paper and their acceptance of a non-manual, non-human method, possibly seen as an intruder  into the Manuscript Studies community. I think that if they see the model  making decisions in the same way that <em>they</em> would make decisions, they will be more likely to see it as an aide doing such things as allowing grad students to analyze fragments rather than finding them. For clarity, I mention that the audience consists of the readers of the Binding-Fragment paper to be submitted to <em>Fragmentology</em>; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) I want to make better decisions as to which model will most-likely make the <strong>goal of ~95% precision and ~70% recall possible on a wide variety of writing-material and binding images</strong>. The ultimate goal for (this stage of) the study is to run the algorithm over as many of FamilySearch's earliest-to-18th Century images (let's make it readable: images from the earliest records they have up to the 1700s) as possible. Through the analysis and visualization of how well the chosen model or models performs, we can have higher confidence that an eventual <strong>one run</strong> over what I'll estimate as 0.5 to 1 billion images with a thoroughly tested and understood/explainable model will <strong>suffice for at least a decade</strong>. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) (This is a long one.) Especially with the Grad-CAM visualizations of the salient features for model decisions, I want to have something to <strong>show to the Manuscript Studies/Fragmentology community that will get them excited</strong> about <em>helping us</em> to <em>create better training sets</em> and to <em>help create new training sets for interesting phenomena/occurences</em> (for lack of a better word describing what each of the classifications describes). I think that the best example of this is to create a model (or add to the existing model) the search for images that not only have iron-gall-ink damage to the point of going through the page (something I have tried to do without expertise), but which are at different stages<sup>\\[NB5\\]</sup> of the iron-gall-ink (and other corrosive dye) damage process. I'm also going to face the fact that, even as concerns the main object of study—fragments found in bindings—I'm perhaps passingly knowledgeable but by no means an expert. Seeing heat maps describing what the model thinks is most important in finding a specific images I've classified should make this a more interesting invitation, as it allows quick view of the types of phenomena such models can find in and on writing materials, bindings, etc.\n",

    "For my estimate of the sum total of such documents, I make reference to the <em>Company Facts</em> page on FamilySearch [as I see it now (archived with numbers updated 2025-04-07)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250423044740/https://www.familysearch.org/en/newsroom/company-facts), which reports \"5.65 Billion \\[Digital Images Published\\]\" .

The type of binding we're seeking is most-commonly found in Western and Central Europe going into Russia and Persia, with some around the Mediterranean—including Muslim and Jewish records—the Near East, and the Americas—mostly (Catholic) South America. Since I think that records from the current United States of America probably take up at least a third of all digital images published, and Western/Central Europe <em>at least</em> one quarter of the remaining digital images, my guess is that a search in those geographical regions from the earliest date for which FamilySearch has records to 1799 will yield approximately<br/>$ \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 5.66 \\times 10^{9} $ images or $ 9.45 \\times 10^{8} \\left(\\substack{+9e8 \\\\ -5e9} \\: \\mathrm{systematic}\\right) \\left(\\pm 0.25e9 \\;  \\mathrm{who} \\! \\cdot \\! \\mathrm{knows}\\right) $,<br/>$ \\frac{1}{6}\\;\\mathrm{ish} $ of the records, 500 million to 1.5 billion (again, very $ \\mathrm{ish} $).<br/>(Note that my methodology will let in records from the 1800s and even a few from the 1900s, but not on purpose.)\n",
