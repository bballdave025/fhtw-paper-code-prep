#>   If you write, in a single .gitattributes file, the two line sequence:
#>      `* text=auto`
#>      `* text eol=lf`
#>  the second line's `text` overrides the first one's, so that `text`
#>  is set (but not to a value) and `eol` is set to a value, with the
#>  value being `lf`. Both lines matched, and the second line overrode
#>  the first.
#>   If you reverse the two lines:
#>      `* text eol=lf`
#>      `* text=auto`
#>  then again both lines match but now the second line only
#>  overrides the text setting, so now you have `text` set to `auto`
#>  and eol set to lf.
#>      `* text eol=lf`
#>      `* text=auto`
#>
#  I'm pretty sure this second version is giving me what I want.

##  Setting the default behavior, in case people don't have
##+ `core.autocrlf` set. Linux-style unless using VS or 
##+ specifically doing CMD/PowerShell scripting
* text eol=lf
* text=auto


## Specific files that ABSOLUTELY need to be treated as text and have
#+ *NIX-style endings. (Note we have no `*.ext text`, because we do
#+ not want any files normalized and converted to native line endings
#+ on checkout.) We also hate CRLF endings, unless someone has built
#+ on VS or is doing CMD/PowerShell scripting


# Force LF for text files
*.html           text eol=lf
*.ipynb          -text  
        # JSON notebooks treated as binary to avoid LF issues
*.yml            text eol=lf
*.txt            text eol=lf
*.log            text eol=lf
*.out            text eol=lf
*.csv            text eol=lf
*.md             text eol=lf
.gitignore       text eol=lf
.gitattributes   text eol=lf

# Checkpoints
*.ipynb_checkpoints   -text

## Probably found automatically, but let's make sure
*.txt            text eol=lf
*.log            text eol=lf
*.out            text eol=lf
*.csv            text eol=lf
*.md             text eol=lf
.gitignore       text eol=lf
.gitattributes   text eol=lf

##  Line endings for specific CMD batch and PowerShell scripts
##+ (could extend to a pattern)



## Denote all files that aren't binary, but which we don't want normalized
*.zip           -text
    ## Possibly useful
*.pdf           -text
*.docx          -text
*.doc           -text
*.rtf           -text
## For presentational stuff.

## Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified
#*.dll           binary
#*.exe           binary
#*.pyc           binary
                        ##  I haven't used any for the project, yet,
                        ##+ but I think it's a good practice when
                        ##+ someting might be run on Windows
                        ##  .gitignore should be set to keep out
                        ##+ the __pycache__
#image files (some in the repo)
*.png           binary
*.jpg           binary
*.jpeg          binary
                        ## I don't like this extension, but safety
*.gif           binary
#audio files (none yet in the repo)
#video files (none yet in the repo)

# Model files
*.h5            binary
*.pt            binary
*.ckpt          binary


## The following extensions exist on files inside the .git directory.
## I assume that, with the 'auto', git will take care of them.
# *.sample ; *.pack ; *.idx
*.sh              text eol=lf
*.ps1             text eol=crlf
*.cmd             text eol=crlf
*.py              text eol=lf
*.md              text eol=lf
*.ipynb           text eol=lf
.gitattributes    text eol=lf
