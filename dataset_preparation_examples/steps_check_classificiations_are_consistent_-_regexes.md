# Checks for Self-Consistency in Image Classification Labels

## The second super-great regex playground&mdash;lookarounds and lots of other fun.

## Project Note

This is one of the nice presentation parts of the RMFB 
(<strong>R</strong>eused <strong>M</strong>anuscript 
<strong>F</strong>ragments in <strong>B</strong>indings) project. 
Actually, `RMFB` is what I'm choosing to be the consistent way I refer
to this project in my GitHub portfolio. It seems short and easy and ... 
well, most of all, it's the one that is the one I picked. You'll likely 
also see the project called 
[`FHTW2025`](https://fhtw.byu.edu/) 
([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20250825172528/https://fhtw.byu.edu/))
(<strong>F</strong>amily <strong>H</strong>istory 
<strong>T</strong>echnology <strong>W</strong>orkshop from the 
March <strong>2025</strong> program
{[archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20250825172644/https://fhtw.byu.edu/program/)}),
closely related to my project start during the 
[FHTW 2024 program](https://fhtw.byu.edu/archive/2024/) 
{[archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20250825172625/https://fhtw.byu.edu/archive/2024/)}).
You will likely run into `RIB-WriST-in-Bin-din`, 
[here's](https://github.com/bballdave025/rib-wrist-in-bin-din) a link 
to what is basically the main project repo as well as to a 
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/bballdave025/rib-wrist-in-bin-din/blob/main/Paper_Code_Prep_01.ipynb) 
(perhaps better seen with the 
[Colab version](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bballdave025/rib-wrist-in-bin-din/blob/main/Paper_Code_Prep_01.ipynb)) 
that serves as a more-detailed README/abstract.
(RIB-WriST-in-Bin-din is my favorite funding-inducing name.) And, if
you're very lucky, you might see it referred to as `P2`
(Résumé GitHub <strong>P</strong>ortfolio Project 
Number <strong>2</strong>).

## The Brainstorming/Idea-Gathering Document With Further Additions

You'll probably want to look at the 
[document with 1-2 page explanations]()
of each classification (with lots of images) and even the 
[shortest classification guide]()
that hangs on the wall next to my computer. That will give you some idea of
the reasons behind the consistency checks. These, and especially the 1-2
page explanations, could be another nice introduction to the Project
motivation
