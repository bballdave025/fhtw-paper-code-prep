#  This is as good a place as any to put these next notes, which
#+ are useful for fixing the new replay cleaning of runscript results
#+ Note to WATCH OUT for false positives when joining lines that
#+ got cut by the right side of the terminal.
#+ The right-side-of-the-terminal thing is why we have a series of
#+ regexes having multiples of 80. If the terminal width has been
#+ changed, the regexes will need to change in order to match the
#+ width. The width can be found with   tput cols
## (Cleaning still not perfect, but better now than before. I'm pretty
#+ sure the problem is specific to Cygwin but haven't tested.)
#
#  The series of regexes is specifically for Notepad++ and has a few
#+ quirks specific to that program. There shouldn't be any spaces.

   Srch:   ^(.{80})\n(.+)$      Repl:   \1\2
   Srch:   ^(.{160})\n(.+)$     Repl:   \1\2

# and so forth with 240, 320, ... if needed.
#>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Need to be added

Fix heredoc when you're typing the enters at the terminal.
Srch:   (^[>]$)|(^[>][ ])   Repl:  
                            That's replacing with nothing
